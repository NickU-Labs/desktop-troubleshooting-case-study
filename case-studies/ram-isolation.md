# Case Study: RAM Isolation & System Instability

## Summary

This case study documents a real-world RAM troubleshooting scenario involving system instability,
boot failures, and secondary GPU-related symptoms.

---

## Initial Symptoms

- System instability
- Failure to boot in specific RAM slot configurations
- GPU not properly detected in Windows
- Severe system lag and UI stuttering

---

## Troubleshooting Process

### 1. Baseline Configuration
- Powered off and unplugged system
- Installed a single RAM stick
- Used motherboard-recommended slot

### 2. Stick and Slot Isolation
- Tested each RAM stick individually
- Tested known-good stick across multiple slots
- Observed boot success/failure per configuration

### 3. OS-Level Verification
- Verified system responsiveness
- Checked Device Manager and Task Manager

---

## Outcome

- Identified a RAM stick that failed in a specific slot
- Restored system stability using a known-good configuration
- Prevented unnecessary motherboard replacement

---

## Key Takeaway

Faulty or unstable RAM can cause misleading secondary symptoms,
including GPU driver failures and display issues.
